# Pre-Session

---

The group is separated, and there are three things we can do:

- Investigate further about the missing student, Valerie Zandermau
- React to Josias' message about an attack happening in a couple of days and Dubok's awakening
- Continue investigating the election that is happening in [Westruun](https://mem.ai/m/legzxRdahxJCI2C6G5ET)

# Session

Balric Eirvan](https://www.notion.so/Balric-Eirvan-5e54126f7962466a9af799bd93f2b615?pvs=21) uses [[Sending]] to message Rexillius Arberlight and tell him of the news that Josias has presented

Rexillius Arberlight and Hendrix Watchtower make way towards the rest of the crew, however Hendrix Watchtower feels a creepy vibe, and they observe their surroundings. Rexillius Arberlight assumes that Balric Eirvan's news isn't the most urgent and they investigate further. He takes out his heart artifact and creates a homunculus named "Not Yet," asking it to fly away and survey the land ahead and report back.

The two notice a specific intersection that is fairly vacated than the others. Investigating further, they feel enough bad energy in this area that they decide to reunite with the squad before engaging further.

They meet the squad back at the [Puddlemuck](https://mem.ai/m/0iZpuYVdbLh6C6BhmnZk) , and Balric Eirvan and Baegoth are visibly disappointed at how long it took for them to arrive. The squad updates each other on what each other knows. Of note, we remember that Dr. Dranzel told us to watch out for Lyssandra Kallos, a candidate with a target on her back.

Of note, two elections are occurring:

- [Westruun](https://www.notion.so/Westruun-ec4c44a294274a9aa1a72bbc14563c25?pvs=21) elections (akin to governor)
- Representatives for [Iman](https://mem.ai/m/eeaBLAaXZ8rxBbgLAhYy) (akin to state representatives)

One of these candidates Elling Zandermau, sibling of Valerie Zandermau, we find is around and is a possible lead to why she's missing.

Rexillius Arberlight requests from Dr. Dranzel a list of representatives for the [Iman](https://mem.ai/m/eeaBLAaXZ8rxBbgLAhYy) . He asks if he can inform [The Golden Grin](https://mem.ai/m/eLdoRSnvlGt6nh8Mu57Q) about this news and see if they can disperse this information. Dr. Dranzel states that the organization does not have close connections to [Lyrengorn](https://mem.ai/m/8wVxjqwrf41wRnZjdcHQ) .

Aghr Nold also informs Dr. Dranzel about our adventures at [Gatshadow Peak](https://mem.ai/m/y3OrqlYOC8gXhjqnT24l) including our adventures with the disease, the [Steel Oath](https://mem.ai/m/jymEqNDaCIyE7ERflbVh) , and Tarisa Vemuri's involvement with the shady activities going around there. Dr. Dranzel now realizes the graveness of the situation.

[[Aghr]]**‚Äôs proposed plan:**

- Protect Lyssandra Kallos
- Investigate the bad vibes [[Rexillius]] and [[Hendrix]] picked up in the [Scholar's Ward](https://mem.ai/m/X2oEQn3BPJaOZtsrdKQK)

Of note:

- Tarisa Vemuri's squad won't be arriving until four days after the election
- We have 100 hours before the election

We decide to head to the [Scholar's Ward](https://mem.ai/m/X2oEQn3BPJaOZtsrdKQK) , with the plan of stopping by [The Alchemist](https://mem.ai/m/A76ZOPLqjaFGXbbXfywf) afterwards to rest. It's 3 AM in the morning as we execute this plan. Most of the streets are pretty empty. We approach the intersection from before, [[Aghr]] is unsurprised as how plain the street looks. Baegoth uses a skill to see if he detects any undead, to no avail.

We head back to [The Alchemist](https://mem.ai/m/A76ZOPLqjaFGXbbXfywf) and long rest.

We remember that Lyssandra Kallos is housed at the [Weaver's Guild](https://mem.ai/m/ipjFL3URS9Lwa4cZFluc) , and we head that direction. We pass by the creepy intersection and Balric Eirvan casts [Detect Magic](https://mem.ai/m/8DjSzMtcMcn2nRNFgEer) . He finds that there is magic emanating from the [Yuminor Observatory](https://mem.ai/m/hhgYdQNTEB66pzYUsEzQ) . We know that the [Scions of Yuminor](https://mem.ai/m/BqncAcHhj9RaWC1f2Oe2) occupy this place, but their purpose has been shrouded in mystery.

[Hillsgold](https://mem.ai/m/5Okp9nQz0iwMfy3Yi4mh) - cultural festival involving a parade

We continue to the [Weaver's Guild](https://mem.ai/m/ipjFL3URS9Lwa4cZFluc) , and we see campaign signage advocating for Lyssandra's vote. There is an open market along the street as well. We walk into the [Weaver's Guild](https://mem.ai/m/ipjFL3URS9Lwa4cZFluc) and notice that we stick out like a sore thumb. Most of the workers here are women. A halfling woman, Rylee Diggle greets us, and we tell her that Dr. Dranzel sent us to meet Lyssandra Kallos.

We ask about the Jeremiah Sook incident and if there's any information she can provide there. Rylee Diggle provides us with Lyssandra Kallos' itinerary:

- **Yulisen**: Speaking at the Brawler's League
- **Da'leysen:** Door to door campaigning in the Market District
- **Miresen**: Symposium at the Ivadium
- **Grissen**: Elections

_(as a reminder, refer to the_ [Days of the Week](https://mem.ai/m/MeNUzxoKd7KmW9KiEV9t) _for_ [Tal'Dorei](https://mem.ai/m/2WGvTShVWTgRrME4HJdH) _)_

Lyssandra and Rylee Diggle understand that they're not safe, as Keona Orren, another candidate who happens to also be part of [The Golden Grin](https://mem.ai/m/eLdoRSnvlGt6nh8Mu57Q) , informed Lyssandra of the misgivings that have been occurring. We also find out that Elling Zandermau works at the [Arcana Pansophical](https://mem.ai/m/pkSFEQ7ULY8BWg2A5Tow) .

We arrive at the [Arcana Pansophical](https://mem.ai/m/pkSFEQ7ULY8BWg2A5Tow) and meet Elling Zandermau, asking about the disappearance of his sister, Valerie Zandermau. He's obviously distressed, and he's considering dropping out of the running for [Iman](https://mem.ai/m/eeaBLAaXZ8rxBbgLAhYy) representative.

Balric casts [Locate Creature](https://mem.ai/m/32wwo0c9uKzx8oIcwbjY) and detects a blip of Valerie, but as he gets closer, her signal disappears. Knowing that running water sometimes mixes up [Locate Creature](https://mem.ai/m/32wwo0c9uKzx8oIcwbjY) , we explore closer to where Balric detects her last. After finding no running water, we surmise that she may be in the [Underwalk](https://mem.ai/m/xCTm4PrR9WQCSNWRoVp5) .
