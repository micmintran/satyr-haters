> [!important]  
> Tezca's Boon (day 3/7) - For the next 7 days you gain 12 temporary hp's, and gain one 1d10 inspiration dice per day  

We continue to run around the trebuchets, but we end up waking up too many troops and ultimately decide to abandon the ship, riding the owls back to Lyrengorn, leaving one trebuchet unscathed.
