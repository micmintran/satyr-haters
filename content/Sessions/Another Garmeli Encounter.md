# Session Notes

---

We continue down the caverns and we see a group of humans as well as a larger-seeming human, maybe an ogre, packing up from a recent battle, tending to their wounds, up on a cliff. [[Aghr]] throws a “Hello, friend!,” and it suddenly is completely silent. [[PD]] flies up to inspect the cliff, and we hear “LEAVE US ALONE!” We persist, climbing up the cliff and following them. We ask if they’d like to join us as allies, however they continue to be guarded and promptly decline. They give us peaceful passage, we continue down the cavern, and shortly encounter a leather-bound journal - with a dick roughly embossed on the back. We notice that there are penises carved throughout the ice around us, and soon enough we hear a lute playing to the north. We continue, and there he is, [[Garmelie]], in his appearance as a satyr. [[Hendrix]] plays a song, though rather crudely, for Garmelie. We notice as well that there are forest creatures gathering next to Garmelie. A female figure emerges, ice on her countenance. She winks at Aghr, and Hendrix continues to play his melody, expertly this time, and we sense that time is flowing a little bit differently now.
