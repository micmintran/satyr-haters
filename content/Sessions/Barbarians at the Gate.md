### **🙟** Lead-In

We successfully destroyed the final trebuchet and encountered enemies upon reaching the ground, who were later joined by Josias and Erzla. After defeating them all and returning to Lyrengorn, we added our energy to the defense efforts via the Moonweaver's Tree. With plans made against Dubok, we now gear up for a second battle and engage.

# Session Notes

---

The battle continues with the barbarians in this forest outside of Lyrengorn. Erzla and Josias battle with us a bit longer, however, make their way toward the center of the city in order to continue their pursuit of Dubok. with Aghr coming along for the ride.

We continue battling against endless barbarians, seemingly countless - we decide on taking out most of the major enemies before many of the barbarians start honing in on us, cornering us up against the wall of the city. We trudge our way towards the gate, with Aghr ahead of us.

# Post-Session

---

It is understood that because we took the time to dismantle the trebuchets earlier and take care of some of the major enemies during this skirmish, our battle with Dubok should be a smidge easier, but we should be on guard nevertheless
