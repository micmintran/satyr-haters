## Session Notes

> Tezca's Boon (day 2/7) - For the next 7 days you gain 12 temporary hp's, and gain one 1d10 inspiration dice per day  

  

We find ourselves in the center of [[Lyrengorn]] from the portal, the portal closing quickly behind us, and despite having done something incredibly magical, most people are not interested due to the chaos unfolding before us. We see the mountain surrounding the city, and we see a shimmer over the mountain. Of note, we see boulders gathered and suspended above the shimmer, suggesting that it serves a protective purpose.

  

[[Rexillius]] looks around to see if there’s any order around this chaos. We find that there are more people heading to the north rather than the south. East/west, there are roads that go into the mountain.

  

One citizen stops by and tells us about the area. We hear that the commander defending against the siege is to the north, and we head that way ourselves. We walk for half an hour. [[Balric]] continues to observe this arcane, shimmering field, but we realize that it doesn’t cover all of the city, and it’s about to end, halfway to the edge of the mountain. He takes note of this amplified fortress, and that it’s not possible by a single spellcaster.

  

[[Balric]] also spots some **wyverns** that are flying about the city, and they’re saddled. This patrol is constantly circling the mountain and city. The farther north we go, we notice more guards and stronger barricades. It’s also early morning.

  

We pass through this arcane barrier, testing the barrier in both directions - a little resistance is noted when trying to enter back into it. More chaos is noted here, spiked barricades are up, and citizens are worried and looking to the sky. The people that have come to the north seem to all have some sort of responsibility, and everyone seems fairly prepared for the attack. We realize at this point that there’s this massive wall spanning the width of the mountain. Stations are posted alongside the wall distributing arms and supplies to citizens for preparation.

  

We find out about the [[Sehanine]] the Moonweaver, who has been protetcing [[Lyrengorn]] from the cold, granting living warmth. A soldier nearby directs us towards [[Skyblade Kir’Zenus]], where we see more wyvern riders grounded and tending to their creatures. We see a larger wyvern, decked out in silver armor. The rider dismounts and is also wearing silver armor. This rider is actually [[Skyblade Kir’Zenus]], and we debrief with him.

  

We find out that patrols are repelling down the mountain, and [[Erzla]] and [[Josias Primmer]] has been helping clear out these patrols. Within the last couple of weeks, the surrounding cities in the north have consolidated into a central force led by [[D&D/Campaign Worlds/𐌕𐋅𐌄 𐌔𐌀𐌕𐌙𐌐 𐋅𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌐𐌔/Bestiary/Dubok, The Annihilon|Dubok, The Annihilon]]. Some treants have been coming towards the city for sanctuary from the [[Alfair Grove]]. These cities that have been gathering together have now approached [[Lyrengorn]] to attempt a siege. This white dragon has also appeared and has been a greater menace to the city.

  

> We learn that white dragons are more primal and are _very_ food motivated. White dragons like to hunt and normally don’t have a horde like other dragons.

  

We also realize that we’re so far north, we only have four hours of daylight - which works towards [[D&D/Campaign Worlds/𐌕𐋅𐌄 𐌔𐌀𐌕𐌙𐌐 𐋅𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌐𐌔/Bestiary/Dubok, The Annihilon|Dubok, The Annihilon]]’s advantage. [[Rexillius]] asks [[Skyblade Kir’Zenus]] if we can borrow some mounts while we help out?

  

Things to do:

- [[Help out the patrol by creating a squadron to sabotage their siege equipment]]
- [[Clear out squads with Erzla and Josias]]

  

We head to the south barracks to talk to [[Erzla]] and [[Josias Primmer]] before accepting either of these quests. [[Josias Primmer]] contacts [[Balric]] via Sending, and we let him know we’re on his way. [[Josias Primmer]] tells us that they’ve been busy fighting the patrols, and he’s sure that they’ll bump into [[D&D/Campaign Worlds/𐌕𐋅𐌄 𐌔𐌀𐌕𐌙𐌐 𐋅𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌐𐌔/Bestiary/Dubok, The Annihilon|Dubok, The Annihilon]] sooner or later. [[Elmendor]] also has supported them as the leader of the treants. His information is sound as he’s been debriefed through [[The Claret Order]].

  

We also learn that the white dragon is an adult dragon named [[Lifusythe]] and that unless we have our own dragon, we won’t be able to reach [[D&D/Campaign Worlds/𐌕𐋅𐌄 𐌔𐌀𐌕𐌙𐌐 𐋅𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌐𐌔/Bestiary/Dubok, The Annihilon|Dubok, The Annihilon]]. [[Josias Primmer]] goes over the usual plan that he does during these patrol raids.

  

We find out that at the center of the city, there is a tree that is a gift from [[Sehanine]] that protects the city, but it requires arcane energy to reinforce. We also discuss the logistics of killing a vampire and considerations with the ethereal plane. We realize that by using the ethereal plane, we may be able to circumvent [[Lifusythe]].

  

We decide to pursue [[Help out the patrol by creating a squadron to sabotage their siege equipment]].

  

Before this, [[Balric]] asks Everiss about what we may be missing out on before we head on this journey. She answers:

> _You have the information you need to succeed. I will be with you. Protect the tree._

[[Balric]] remembers his vision about [[D&D/Campaign Worlds/𐌕𐋅𐌄 𐌔𐌀𐌕𐌙𐌐 𐋅𐌀𐌕𐌄𐌐𐌔/Bestiary/Dubok, The Annihilon|Dubok, The Annihilon]] axing into a white tree, the same one that is here in [[Lyrengorn]]. We agree to protect the tree during the assault. We proceed with our sabotage quest.

  

We arrive and see these four, huge, black owls. We mount them, dive over the wall, and proceed forward. Immediately as we clear the edge of the wind, we are hit with a biting wind. The owls can tolerate this and deftly navigate these winds. Surrounding the top of the mountain is a forest covered with snow, above that, cold tundra. There are purple northern lights that tendril through the night sky and illuminate the ground. We see that there are thousands upon thousands of barbarians gathered in the south. We also see movement amongst the trees - trolls that are proceeding toward the peak of the mountain.

  

In the distance amongst this army, we see a clearing with a couple of campfires. Catapults and trebuchets have been built here, and the owls start to dive toward this area. The owls perch on low branches in an area with no movement, ideal for a place to be dropped off. We’re about 2,000 feet out from the campsites where the siege weapons are being created.

  

During surveillance of the land, we saw two tents, with one hulking figure that patrols the siege weapons. We find out he’s a [[Frostgiant]], a larger one at that. Otherwise, the rest of the patrol is inside their tents.

## Summary

A group arrives in Lyrengorn city through a portal and discovers chaos due to a siege. They learn of a protective magical barrier around the city and head north to help defend it. They meet Skyblade Kir'Zenus who tells them about the enemy led by Dubok, The Annihilon. They form a squadron to sabotage siege equipment and clear out enemy squads with Erzla and Josias, who inform them of the white dragon named Lifusythe.
