## Session Notes

After the fight with drows and demons and discovering the missing girl. The team takes a short moment to decide what is next, aghr and rex discover a hidden corner that goes deeper but the gang decided to take the girl back to her father. After delivering the girl, the father offered 100gp but Aghr denies and implies a favor and establishing a relationship was all that was needed for doing the good of the realm.

The group ponders what is next over a few drinks and decides potentially that they should handle the lyrengorn issue and possibly make it back in time for the final election and arrival of the batallion. Balric goes to the arcana pansophical and asks about teleportation to lyrengorn which is possible but expensive. Balric decides to message his brother to learn more about potential alternatives and the true depth of the issue. Apparently there is a red dragon and vampire marching on lyrengorn and the main tree is burned down so communication has been cut off between syngorn and lyrengorn. They learn of a group of druids in the temple ward that has ties to lyrengorn and decide to visit them for transportation.

Transportation is possible but might be risky. The gang decides it is beneficial for the realm to go to Lyrengorn so want to tie up the election loose ends quickly before teleporting. Before leaving, someone asks the druid guy if he could potentially remove tezca curse which he was happy to do for a 150gp donation. Hendrix gives the guy a peptalk and rolled. Tezca the frog floats into the air during the guys spells and the entire party is struck with a blinding light. Once the light fades, a 30 ft tall coatl is standing there. We speak to Tezca and ask if he remembers us and Tezca agrees to offer us a boon for freeing him.

> [!important]  
> Tezca's Boon - For the next 7 days you gain 12 temporary hp's, and gain 1d10 inspiration dice per day  

Aghr pleads with Tezca for assistance with the modern-day version of the calamity they are facing and Tezca offers us assistance. Rex suggests healing the cursed battalion approaching Westruun and Tezca obliges. We offer each other see you later and Tezca floats spiraling into the sky joined in flight by PD. They whirl together like yin and yang in a beautiful display and then part ways. Tezca flew off into the sky and PD returned us.  
With army taken care of, the gang splits up to handle the rest of the politics business
