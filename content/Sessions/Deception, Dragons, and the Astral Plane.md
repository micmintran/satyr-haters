## Session Notes

The party heads to the Wayward Pony, inform Fetch about delivering the chest, successfully deceiving him about the theft. We pick up a quest at Steel Oath, stop off at Westhall to check in with Urkie who is in a lecture. We burn time at the Cobalt Reserve:

Rex finds out more about dragons, the island of Marquette where blue dragons are, Shardolon was one of the most powerful dragons out there, a dragon called Imryth that was neutral through the Cataclysm, fought for Kord the Stormlord, defended Marquette. Also found out about the Chroma Conclave, Umbrasil who was defeated, aligned with a blue dragon called Brimscythe, masquerading as General Krieg in the army of Aman (imperial T’aldorei army) who was also defeated alongside the Chroma Conclave 5-6 years ago by a band of heroes called Vox Machina. Currently, a fledgling Republic rules the land with an advisory council. The whereabouts of Vox Machina are unknown at this time. Green/blue dragons are the most intelligent, white dragons are less so.

Balric investigates Gulthias/Shardolon, and it’s initially difficult to find the texts. Shardolon and Gulthias were aligned with The Scaled Tyrant, who helped accelerate The Cataclysm. A citadel of the Scaled Tyrant, north of Vasselheim was mentioned, NW of T’aldorei - very cold area and snowbound; not much is known about the place. Vasselheim is also the remaining city surrounding the history of the Cataclysm.

We make our way back to Westhall and meet with Urkie - he brings up the bonebox. He reports that the quest to the Yuan’ti will take a minimum a month. Urkie muses that the Yuan’ti temple may be related to Shardolon in some way.

The next day, we approach the Tower of Eskil in the evening per the Steel Oath quest. We enter, ascending the tower and meet Eskil, who offers to transfer us to the Astral Plane as part of the Steel Oath quest. We are transported, standing on a stone platform in the Astral Plane.
