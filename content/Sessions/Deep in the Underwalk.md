## Session Notes

We head down into the Underwalk, and it’s completely pitch black. As we make our way into sewers, we encounter these small spiders that are fairly easy to vanquish.’

We encounter a larger swarm of them, some of which we find out can spell cast.

Rexillius summons his homunculus, a robot version of PD

We find that there are coccoons at the end of the sewers, and we see that there’s a corpse of a halfling in one of them. We find that Valerie is in one, with two other corpses noted in the others. Valerie is near death, but luckily we save her with Healing Word. We realize that the dark elves, also fighting alongside the spiders, is the same as the elves in the dungeon we previously explored.
