## Session Notes

We enter the next room, and we realize that Isgaroth is even older, and he was kind of trapped in the previous room in his past memories. This room is full of different doors - we pass through one marked with a book and he gives 2 books to **Eskil**. We go through another door about Everess, and **Balric** is given a weapon. We learn a little more about **Gulthias**. **Eskil** recommends we follow up with the **Arcana Pansophical** to see what to do, specifically Seanor as well.

  

We get back to the inn, and we bump into some curious characters. A half-orc plays the violin, **Dr. Dranzel.** He’s part of a traveling band, where we meet **Zedd, Elsimere, and Okor.** We notice that they’re all wearing necklaces with a crescent shape on them. We go to sleep and level up. We wake up and spar each other (**Argh** and **Hendrix** lose to **Rex** and **Baegoth**), then short rest at the inn with several options:

  

- Present the fake quill to Fetch
- Pursue things with **Urkie**
- Go to Drynna to further investigate the Clasp
- Go the the library to find out more about the quill
