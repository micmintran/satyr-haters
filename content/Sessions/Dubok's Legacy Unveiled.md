## Announcements

### Lead-In

With the paper of Sending that we obtained from the vampire crypt, Aghr writes the the changeling vampire, [[Ataxia]], with this message:

> changeling, want to change sides. We have staked dubok.  
> Check yes or no.  
> Sinsiriely, aghr and friends  
> ps, what do with body? it keeps growing tree  
> PPS who are you?  
> PPPS u up  

[[Ataxia]] responds back quickly with:

> Welcome to the game, little pawns. Although, I may need to refer you as knights, no? You have certainly elevated yourselves beyond all expectations. While your proposal is certainly amusing, I must admit that my loyalties have been obligated to another. While the written word may not be your particular forte, do not think that I underestimate your abilities to the degree of my siblings. I have enjoyed our parleys and look forward to encountering your fine group again in the future.

[[Rexillius]] responds, writing the margins:

> It seems you aren't against our offer. Perhaps the enemy of your enemy is your friend. We will lay your brother to rest permanently, Hopefully our interests will continue to align.

# Session Notes

---

We wake from our longrest. As we approach the tree again, where the branch was severed, and we find that an [[Azuremite]] crystal has been sent via the [[Numat Trick Tube]] found on [[Dubok, The Annihilon]]’s body.

Using Channel Divinity, [[Balric]] reads the crystal and is transported to an arena with a child in the center. A cage at the opposite end opens, and a wolf emerges and charges at the kid. The kid defeats this wolf, and is brought up to Balric from his perspective. We learn that this memory is Dubok’s, and the kid is [[Ogra]], Dubok’s son.

Balric consults [[Everis Quilar]] about Ogra, only to find out that Everiss only knew Dubok after he turned into a vampire, before his personal life.

We head to the center of town for a meeting - [[Skyblade Kir’Zenus]] stops us and gives us the [[Quicksilver Sword]], a weapon that has been in his family for many generations, as a gift of gratitude.

We meet with [[Thasinia Venceran]], who gifts us with an armor made by stone suspected to have been a gift from the [[Moonweaver]], the [[Starmetal Nova Armor]], and a chest full of money. She also informs us that a piece of Seergaunt, a clipping from a king treant, is missing and is with King Aeog, a frostgiant. [[Baegoth the Downtrodden]] notices the lack of enthusiasm from [[Aghr Nald]] - he makes plans with Balric to intervene tonight while resting.

Balric checks in with [[Dr. Dranzel]], who sends us this message:

> There you are! We're in quite the mess and you're right in the middle of it. You really know nothing? We thought Aghr had died.

> [[Tarissa Vemuri]] was attacked and has gone missing. The Margrave declared martial law and your band of fools is wanted for her murder.

> We scarcely believed it, but the Margrave has put Aghr's body on display in the Town Square as a warning. The election was delayed indefinitely.

The group is astounded.
