# Session Notes

---

The Arbiter of Erathis, in the presence of Dubok, begins glowing brightly and heating up ferociously, however Balric doesn’t feel pain from this. The arbiter has become awakened, and Everiss’ voice emerges from it saying, “I want REVENGE for this!” with Balric dashing towards the vampire Dubok. Erzla continues with his reckless ways of combat. Lifusythe is vanquised, and Dubok makes a run for the inner tree chamber.
