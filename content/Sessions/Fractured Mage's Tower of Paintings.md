## Session Notes

We enter the tower painting, and we have a man rushing to save someone. We go after him, a path winding around a mountain, and this man continues to run. Boulders are falling down, and we continue to run up and get attacked by harpies. We make it to the top and fight giants, help this man who is a mage to get into the castle, only to find the doors to be a portal back to the study. We go back to the study, and the mage we helped is now the same young adult from previously, now matching in age. He’s having a conversation with **Eskil**, and we realize this is Isgaroth. Everess is gone. We find out the Isgaroth has been spending a lot of time here, and he fractured himself into these paintings. We place the last medallion onto the door and open the door.
