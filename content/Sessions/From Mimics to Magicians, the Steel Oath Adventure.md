## Session Notes

**Argh** arrives at the **Steel Oath**, registers with the agency. Makes clear that he must abide by all laws in cities that he is in, membership can be revoked otherwise. He passes, **Argh** is now a member.

Jump to the squad, delivering the chest, attempting to unlock to no avail - but then it turns into a mimic - the squad defeats it. **Argh**, back at the **Steel Oath** - takes up a quest involving magical skills of an individual, requested by **Eskil** - a magician **Eskil** **Ryndarien**, in the past influential with the politics of **T’aldorei**.

The squad visits Westhall Academy to appeal to Seanor about the shenanigans of Fetch. Seanor provisions a quill that looks like the raven-feather quill but is not the real thing. We grab some chests that look like the chest we were supposed to give to the owner of the **Golden Buckle**

We give the painted chest to the owner, with the idea of stealing the chest later in order to leave this Clasp situation clean. We steal back the chest and trash the shop successfully in the middle of the night and return to the Inn.
