## Session Notes

In the Astral Plane, **Eskil** asks if we know **Isgaroth**, a pre-Cataclysm entity. We have entered his living place. We’re trying to find answers for **Eskil** from him. We enter the door in the Astral Plane, which then turns into a staircase ascending a tower. We defeat enemies in an entryway, then enter a study with a child and an automaton sitting at a table. Four large paintings are in this room, **1st: lady in fine clothes with a tiara, 2nd: knight in armor in an underground cave, 3rd: cleric in a library reading a book, 4th: tower up on a mountain path.** The kid doesn’t know his name, and he’s playing a game on the table. We play the chess game, and the paintings become portals. **Argh** and **Balric** end up in the maze painting in the 1st frame. The rest of the crew follows. We end up in a maze, find an old man and bring him out of the painting. We think him and the kid playing the chess game are somehow related. We enter the knight painting, which is cave-themed.
