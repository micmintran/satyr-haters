## Session Notes

We head to the Cobalt Reserve to figure out more about the Raven quill, related to the Raven queen. We find out that the Raven queen used to reside in the **Shadowfell**, the realm opposite the Feywild. We find out that she gained an affinity for collecting people’s memories and storing them in globes. We find out the feather came from her cloak and is all about collecting memories.

We go to the Wayward Pony to approach Fetch. We confess that we can’t get the quill, and so he suggests that we follow up in **Drynna.** We agree, and leave the bar. We go to **Eskil** and ask for his teleportation services tomorrow to get to Drynna, he agrees. We stop by **Urkie**, and he tells us he’s found out more about the Y’uanti temple map. He states that he would arrange transport through Stilbin, but we would have to meet there with **Korcan Voldru** in a month.

We know the temple is called Ixzalquatl, used to worship **Zehir**, a betrayal god - most of his followers were annihilated during the Calamity. He’s associated with subterfuge, poisoning, and assassination.

We head to the Floating Flumph late at night. Dwarves are everywhere. We meet up with **Dr. Dranzel and the Spectacular Traveling Troupe**. We play axes with **Ghukina.**

The squad wins twice.
