- Everyone but Titus and Michael played in person today!

### Lead-In

A group arrives in Lyrengorn city through a portal and discovers chaos due to a siege. They learn of a protective magical barrier around the city and head north to help defend it. They meet Skyblade Kir'Zenus who tells them about the enemy led by Dubok, The Annihilon. They form a squadron to sabotage siege equipment and clear out enemy squads with Erzla and Josias, who inform them of the white dragon named Lifusythe. We arrive at the campsite where the siege weapons are stored…

## Session Notes

We note that there’s a frostgiant, alongside several guardsmen around these weapons that we intend on sabotaging. We intend to charm the giant and cast silence to prevent him from alerting the rest of the troops around the campsite.

  

We spend quite a bit of time charming and suggesting the frostgiant on the watch to help us sabotage the trebuchets present on the campgrounds. This ultimately causes a bit of a ruckus, and more enemies encroach on our position.
