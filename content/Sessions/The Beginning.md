## Session Notes

Killed owlbears, found a hat that belonged to a satyr that loves drawing dicks; onwards to **Westruun** on main road

Arrive at a fork in the road towards **Westruun**, stop at the small tavern “The Traveler’s Inn,” lots of people in the tavern.

Rudolph (illusioned as Pavel) is already at the tavern, thanking the group for finding his hat, some of the people are illusions as well. **Hendrix** puts on a show, **Rex** hypes up the crowd.

Pressure **Rudolph**, explains the box - explains about the “age of arcanum,” where magic roamed free; changed into the appearance of a woman. Magic got out of hand, mortals began to think they were gods. The **Ravenqueen** was a mortal, her magical power corrupted her and decided she wanted to be a god; she was the last of us to descend to the divine plane - she is now divine, and her ascension caused dissension amongst the gods, caused a war called **The Cataclysm**.

**The Cataclysm** killed many people, not many survived - the world was very different at the end, **Pelor** triumphed over evil. People in this land have kept a sharp eye on magic users in an effort to prevent history from repeating itself. Keep an eye on fledgling magic users.

Recapped experience with **Gulthias** to **Rudolph**; verified by **Sharwyn**. Turns into gentleman, cane now is super nice-looking, named **Seanor**, Member of the **Arcana Pansophical**. In communication with **Kerwyn**, he visited the family several years ago, and now heard about this gang of people who saved **Sharwyn**. The “journey” to Greencrest was a test. The satyr who drew dicks on the carts was actually a friend of **Seanor**.

Repeatedly requests for the box of the **Ravenqueen**. Throws a vial that causes Mass Suggestion, **Hendrix** gives the box back. **Urkie** works for **Seanor**. **Seanor** says he’ll welcome us at **Westhall Academy**, advises using Detect Magic - reveals that he has glasses that are magical that we can use to verify his identity. Purple sparrow (Niva) is Seanor’s familiar.

**Hendrix** asks about **the Clasp** - **Seanor** refutes them, states that they’re a whole bunch of thieves, bandits, drug dealers. **Baegoth** shows **Seanor** the ring - **Hendrix** recognizes the ring as an indicator of Clasp agents, as **Leaf** also wore this ring (this indicates that **Karakus** was part of the **Clasp**). **Seanor** admits that the higher levels are more sophisticated and the ring is a designation of an alias within the organization.

_“Help Drynna Myriad Here Root”_ - **Seanor** recognizes the **Myriad** from **Wildemount**. We’re on the continent of **Tal'dorei**, **Wildmount** is the continent to the east. **Myriad** has been trying to infiltrate the continent and are opponents of the **Clasp**.

**Rex** draws a bath, **Hendrix** attempts to grab some groupies, meets **Cora**, gets it on.

_Next day, arrive at another tavern at 8 PM, party rests_

_Next day, approach 30 foot white walls, gates of_ _**Westruun**_.

**Westruun** is run by a militant official named **Margrave,** who runs **The Shield**, **Westruun** is under militant control. The city itself was destroyed by dragons earlier, **Margrave** has done a lot to restore the city.

Arrive at **Westhall Academy**, met by **Seanor** and an elven woman (**Tarisa**). **Urkie** is dropped off.

## Summary

The group continues their journey towards Westruun, after defeating some owlbears and finding a hat that belonged to a satyr who loves to draw obscene images. They arrive at a fork in the road and stop at a small tavern, The Traveler’s Inn, where they meet Rudolph, who is illusioned as Pavel, and many other people, some of whom are also illusions. Hendrix and Rex entertain the crowd while the group learns about the “age of arcanum” and the Cataclysm, a war caused by the Ravenqueen's ascension. They also meet Seanor, a member of the Arcana Pansophical, who is interested in obtaining the box of the Ravenqueen. The group agrees to meet Seanor at Westhall Academy, where they are also introduced to an elven woman named Tarisa. They learn that Westruun is under militant control and run by a strict official named Margrave.
