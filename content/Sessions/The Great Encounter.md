# Session Notes

---

We all ran into the town square and we fight Dubok and Lifusythe - multiple times Aghr was able to knock this weapon out of Dubok’s hand, and we eventually were able to banish Lifusythe into thin air. Rexillius was able to use his Horn of Valhalla to summon these Berserkers that are swinging the advantage into the crew’s favor. Skyblade Kyrzenis’s wyvern has also been killed entirely.
