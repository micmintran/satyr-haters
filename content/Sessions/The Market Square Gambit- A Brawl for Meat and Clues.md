## Session Notes

The gang heads over to the Market Square, buying items. Arrive at _**Behind the Veil**__,_ identifies an amulet that **Rex** owns - ends up being a normal amulet. Visit **Westruun** Weapons, buy weapons. Visit tannery, sell owlbear merch. Visit the World Market - eat some food there, told that we could sell back meat for 2 silver a pound from Yazzin, the fire Genasi meat merchant.

**Argh** is convinced by the party to participate in the **Brawler’s League**, under the guise of **Skullmaw**. **Rex** accompanies him, the rest staying in the stands. **Argh** fights **Aziza the Graceful -** he succeeds. We make our way to Puddlemuck’s to get **Argh** out of his guise. We go to sleep at the Inn.

Next morning, we have breakfast and we visit the Puddlemuck to meet up with Hilt. Hilt introduces us to **Fetch** - who reveals that Karakus is code named Leaf, who was designated to deliver the Myriad message to Fetch. To gain his trust, we must do several things:

- Deliver a chest to the Golden Buckle in the Market Ward - go to the back of the building, knock fast 3 times, slow twice, and someone will pick it up
- Obtain the raven-feather quill from Seanor’s office in the Westhall Academy

We leave the bar - and discuss with the group what is next.
