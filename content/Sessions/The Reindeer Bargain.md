### Lead-In

We decided to head out and help [[Recover Cedargaunt’s tree clipping from King Aeog]].

# Session Notes

---

We borrow wyverns from [[Thasinia Venceran]], which allows us to quickly fly over to where King Aeog has been spotted. Before heading out, we stopped for supplies. As we exit the protective shield of the Moonweaver that protects Lyrengorn, we’re faced with the brutal cold and are exhausted due to this. We set up camp right outside where we believe King Aeog is located. We long rest here, however upon [[Balric]]’s watch, he observes that there is a herd of reindeer coming towards us. Come to find out, these reindeer were actually herded by goblins - we meet them and decide to run a bargain to buy some reindeer from them in preparation for our encounter with King Aeog. We ride with these reindeer, only to be encountered by a vicious storm, except it’s not a vicious storm, but a monster…
