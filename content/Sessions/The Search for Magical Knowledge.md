## Session Notes

We help out in the cave, fixing a transference machine for an old man - we succeed, and get transported back to the study. The kid is now a teenager. We enter the cleric painting, into a library. We bump into a magician in training, who’s looking for several books and asks for help: **Making Magi-Mechanical Constructs, Chronurgy: A Study of Temporal Dynamics, Spiritual Transference, You and Your Simulacrum, and You**. He is also accompanied by the Librarian, an automaton that assists the magician. We find all the books, **Balric** goes through this trance but fails at perfectly balancing justice. We bring the magician back through the portal, and the teenager is now older, young adult range.
