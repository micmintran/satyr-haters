## Session Notes

We finish the darts game, Dranzel’s group is still playing in the background. They eventually stop to intermission, and the group disperses. The crew splits up to follow different parts of the band. We find out that the band has a political motive and want to “stick up for the little man.” We also find out that the band has recently come from Foramir. The party continues and Argh challenges a dwarf Gammut to an arm-wrestling competition.The party ends, and we make our way to the inn. We notice that someone is following us home - we don’t end up finding them.

  
We receive a crude map of the Y’uanti temple from Urkie. We check out of the inn. We meet up with Eskil for the teleport appointment. We teleport and meet Crispus Lakenhall in Drynna. We find out that there’s been an influx of immigrants due to orcs. There’s an agency called The Shield, also located in Turst Fields, that helps defend the town. We go to the fish market in a tour with Cripus, then arrive at Vella’s Respite. We find out that there was a lot of magic in this area that caused chaos, now trapped inside a rock in the middle of the lake. The lake is now enshrouded in a magical mist that no one ventures into. We head to a town hall meeting. Crispus is there, alongside the town council. We meet Binjib Mooren, part of the Mooren family, who owns the marina. We also meet Jilvic Smudbar, who owns a shipping company. Carrith Vamariss seems practical, leader of the Steel Oath. Gustav Hutten is a bureaucratic type. Eline Sandelin is the lead cleric of the town. Zorrin Prieto is the lead of the Shield in town. They are all meeting to address the orc problem surrounding town. We team up with Carrith to fix the orc problem.
