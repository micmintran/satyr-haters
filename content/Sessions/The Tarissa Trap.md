# Session Notes

---

- We return the branch to Cedargaunt, who awakes and the treants are pleased that he is back
- Baegoth receives a magical bow, endowed with the power of [[Lifuscythe]], the ice dragon.
- We receive news that we were framed by [[Tarissa Vemuri]] while we away, however our name was cleared after it was revealed that [[Brandon Zimmerset]] was charmed by Tarisa as well. We are asked to join the authorities of Westruun to track her down.
- We turn to Westruun, and [[Rexillius]] attempts to find Eskil, to no avail. We also go to The Alchemist, where we meet Brewlaugh Kegstander, the primary keeper of our bar.
- We learn of the following elected officials:
    - Mayor - Brandon Zimmerset
    - Advisors:
        - Minister of Arcana - [[Zina Sikorna]] (Arcana Pansophical)
        - Minister of Information - [[Keona Orren]] (Golden Grin)
        - Minister of Defense - [[Sebastian Namavar]] (Shield)
        - Minister of Commerce - [[Raytham Ulan]] (Opal Trust)
        - Minister of Development - [[Blaine Kraverogg]] (Adept of the Miracle League)
        - Minister of Law - [[Lysandra Kallos]]
- [[Dr. Dranzel]] informs us that there is a connection to Kymal and Westruun. He gives us the name of a person to check out - [[Prudence]]. It’s obvious that Dr. Dranzel is a little disappointed that we were gone during the elections.
- [[Balric]] is able to bed Dr. Dranzel, of which he catches feelings for.
- [[D&D/NPCs/Aziza|Aziza]] is damaged, but she’s in repair at the Cobalt Soul. [[Aghr]] is glad to find out she’s fine, and she got upgraded to being a field agent.
- We also meet with [[Seeker Assum]] , who has more information about Tarisa Vemuri.
    - Her history/backstory is suspiciously patchy - he has tried to be a thorough researcher, but there are months that are missing and unaccounted for. This time is specifically when she leaves Syngorn and arrives in Westruun.
    - Every couple of months, she also left Westruun and would be gone for weeks at a time, falling off the face of the earth
    - He also reports the presence of azuremite, which is only available in the Underdark cave system in Iman.
- We find out the copies of us were created via the spell Simulacrum - we learn about a [[Nikeese Vaugren]] that may have [[Grah]], Aghr’s doppelgänger.
- [[Rexillius]] finally receives his upgraded automaton, pending a name that he will converse later

# Post-Session

1. We will investigate [[Keona Orren]] and [[Brandon Zimmerset]] for more information about Tarisa Vemuri, perhaps ask Eskil about a changeling
2. We’ll head to Kymal afterward
