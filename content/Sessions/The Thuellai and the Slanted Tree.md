### Lead-In

This cloud of snow and storm comes approaching us, our newly acquired reindeer quivering on their hooves…

# Session Notes

---

We engage with this storm cloud, and we find out that it is actually a [[Thuellai]] - a serpent, effervescent and violent, that pummels our group with an onslaught of ice and fury. [[Baegoth]] is nearly brought down, however through the dense work of [[Aghr]], the Thuellai brought down in short order, calming the winds once again, albeit down to a blizzard. We continue down the path, long rest for a night, where [[Balric]] observes a tree in the distance that has been growing at a strange 45 degree incline. We wake up, and make our way towards the tree.
