# Session Notes

---

Rexillius decides at the last minute to shoot at the last trebuchet and succeeds in doing so, destroying the last trebuchet. We decide to further thwart the enemies’ efforts by landing among the trees right outside their outpost.

As we land, we immediately encounter enemies and make short work of them, with Erzla and Josias showing up to assist us near the end of the battle. We inspect the area, and we find a currency that belongs to the continent of Wildemount. Josias is ultimately puzzled by how this currency even got here in the first place. We ask on the off chance if Erzla and Josias know about Marceline Vas - drawing blank expressions from both of them.

---

We arrive back in Lyrengorn proper, to visit the tree after our battles to see if we can drop off the rest of our magical power to the Moonweaver’s tree at the center of town. to add to the defense efforts. Once done, we head to bed at the local inn.

The next morning, we meet with Skyblade Kir’Zenus to discuss strategies regarding Dubok the Annihilon, his dragon, and how we’ll defeat them. Rexillius decides he can make ballistas with his Artificer skills - Hendrix joins to help him with this effort. We prepare for battle.

---

We reach the battlefield. We see huge battering rams wielded by 12-15 foot giants. There is a sea of barbarians ahead of us.

On our side, we have many commanders in charge of the archers and the wyvern riders. We hear a large horn call in the distance - this is shortly followed by the white dragon, Lifuscythe flying above the horizon, approaching us swiftly.

We position ourselves on the walls of Lyrengorn, and battle commences. Frost giants hurl boulders at us, ice faeries are summoned and create a foggy mist among the enemy. We charge forward, and as Lifuscythe approaches, we see a burly figure riding the dragon - we can only assume this is the Annihilon. The enemies fly away from us, with a lot of the enemies staying behind - we decide to finish some of them off before pursuing
