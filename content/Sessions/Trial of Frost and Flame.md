### Lead-In

We wake up from a long rest, curious about this slanted tree in the distance.

# Session Notes

---

[[Rexillius]] observes this tree in the distance and decides that it’s not quite a tree. We advance towards this “tree,” and the form becomes more apparent - the tree is actually a large wooden pole, buried in the ice, with three very decayed corpses hanging from the top. [[Aghr]] digs down the snow to ice, and we find that this pole is stuck in the ground, suggesting that it was in the water prior to the water being frozen.

We notice that a storm is rolling in. We know that the Frost Giants’ village is north of this frozen lake, and we realize we need to decide whether or not we want to traverse around or across the lake. We decide to traverse directly across the lake.

We reach these small islands of rocks, but [[Balric]] notices an orange flash speed through the ice. It seems familiar. Memories from [[Gatshadow Peak]] comes to mind, and just as they do, a [[Remorhaz 2]] pops up from the ice! After a bit of struggle, we end up making short work of the Remorhaz - after this, the storm clears, and we reach the other end of the lake.

We approach this cave near the north end of the lake, seeing large, ice spears embedded in the ground. We suddenly hear a large booming female voice - and we meet, a female Frost Orc proud of her athleticism and combat ability. [[Aghr]] talks to her and manages to default to the use of bartering, with a following of friendly combat that may (or may not) result in death. Based on the results of both of these, we may be able to maximize our ability of getting into the village, while also retrieving the branch of Cedargaunt. This is a female frost giant named [[Aligsa]] guarding the entrance. Through some persuasion and offerings of ale, they convince her to send word to the frost giant king to allow them to potentially trade dragon scales for access to the tree.

Alexa agrees to let the group wait nearby while she confers with the king. The players decide to long rest while waiting for her return. They plan to first attempt to trade gold and dragon scales for the tree branch. If that fails, they will suggest a contest of combat between their best fighter and one of the giants' warriors, with the prize being the tree piece they seek.

The session ends with the players taking a long rest in preparation for further negotiations and potential combat with the frost giants.
