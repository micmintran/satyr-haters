## Announcements

Michael was out last week, Austin played in his place

### Lead-In

- Trying to sneak through cavern to grab the branch
- Sneaking past wolves and others past a chasm
- Bumped into yetis - battling them now...

Apparently [[Aghr]]’s full name is Aghrtorius

# Session Notes

---

We continue battle with the yetis that we’ve encountered and make short order of them. We continue and find a small cave, fairly unremarkable.
